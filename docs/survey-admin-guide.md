# Survey admin guide (phase 1: teacher review T1)

For the principal and admin. Screens are in Bengali; this guide names them as they appear.
Admin pages are at **`/admin`** (same login as the Studio). Content setup is in the **Studio → Surveys** group.

## One-time setup (Studio → Surveys)

1. **Teachers (survey)** — one document per teacher: ERP ID (from the ID card, e.g. `20099`), Bengali name, Active.
   Teachers start a survey by typing this ID and confirming their name, so it must match the card. This list is separate from the website's teacher profiles. Inactive teachers are left out of new rounds.
   The 28 teachers from the ERP export are already loaded; eight had no Bengali name in the export and show the English one until it is filled in. A new teacher: add the document here (or run the seed with `--teachers` on a fresh export, which only adds missing ones).
2. **Classes & Subjects** — the nine classes are already there (প্লে … ষষ্ঠ). For each class:
   - **Subjects**: key + Bengali name (e.g. `arabic` · আরবি). Already loaded: Play has one subject, সব বিষয়; Nursery–Five have আরবি, ইসলাম শিক্ষা, বাংলা, ইংরেজি, গণিত; Six adds বিজ্ঞান and বাংলাদেশ ও বিশ্বপরিচয়. Names can be edited; keys cannot after publishing.
   - **Sections** (Nursery, KG: A/B; Two, Three: বালক/বালিকা) with their **ERP section names** exactly as the ERP export writes them (`Section A`, `Section B`, `Male`, `Female`).
   - **ERP class names**: the class label in the ERP export (e.g. `Nursery`).
3. **Templates** — the T1 template (7 questions, hints, areas) is already there. Change wording only before a round opens; changing marks or the scale means a new template version.
4. **Areas** — the 12 areas are already there; they rarely change.

Keys can be corrected until the document is first published; after that the Studio refuses changes, because stored answers use them.

## Every round

1. **Import the student list** — `/admin` → **ERP ইমপোর্ট**. Download the Student List from the ERP (CSV or Excel), upload it, and read the preview:
   - *সমস্যা* rows: rows without an ID or name, or with a class/section that has no ERP name in the Studio, are skipped; an unreadable roll or phone is imported blank.
   - *নিষ্ক্রিয় হবে*: students missing from the file are marked inactive (never deleted). If many would be deactivated, the page asks you to confirm it is the full list.
   - Fix mappings in the Studio and check again; then **ইমপোর্ট করুন**. The problem list can be downloaded as Excel.
2. **Create the round** — Studio → Surveys → Rounds → new: label (e.g. অক্টোবর ২০২৬), template, link name (e.g. `t1-2026-10`), opening and closing time. **Publish**.
3. **Open it** — either the **Open round** button on the round in the Studio, or `/admin` → **রাউন্ড** → *রাউন্ড খুলুন* (where you can still adjust the dates). Opening copies the questions, classes, subjects and teachers into the round; later Studio edits do not change it. If a teacher or subject was missing, add it in the Studio and press **তালিকা হালনাগাদ** on the round.
4. **Share the link** — **লিংক কপি** on the rounds page; send it to the teachers' group. The link contains a key; anyone with it can open the survey, so share it only with teachers. Each teacher types the ERP ID from their ID card and confirms their name; their phone remembers it for the round. If an ID is not found, check the teacher's document in the Studio, then press **তালিকা হালনাগাদ** on the round.
5. **Follow progress** — **রেসপন্স ট্র্যাকার** shows each class × subject as জমা / খসড়া / ডুপ্লিকেট / বাকি, teachers' unfinished drafts (with last edit and device), and duplicates.
   - **Duplicate** = two teachers submitted the same class and subject. Choose whose to keep, or keep both if both teach it. The one not kept stops counting in reports; nothing is deleted, and that teacher's receipt says so.
6. **Extend or close** — **মেয়াদ বাড়ান** (also reopens a closed round; drafts are kept) or **এখনই বন্ধ**. After closing, teachers on the review screen still have 10 minutes to submit.

## Reports

- **ক্লাস ও শিক্ষার্থী** — pick a class or search a student by name, ID or roll.
  - Class: teacher average per student (/১০), areas, flags (dropped ≥ 1 mark since the student's last round; ≥ 2 teachers gave ৪), trends from the second round. Aggregates resting on fewer than 3 students are grey.
  - Student: areas against the class average, subject × question marks, teachers' notes, all submissions. **অভ্যন্তরীণ প্রিন্ট** includes notes — do not hand it to guardians. The guardian print arrives with the guardian surveys (phase 2).
- **শিক্ষকদের রেটিং প্যাটার্ন** — each teacher's average, mark spread, how generous compared with colleagues on the same students, and batches where almost every mark is the same.
- Every table has **Excel**; every page prints to PDF.

## Copies and backups

- Every submission is copied to the **Survey Responses** Google Sheet (one tab per round, one row per student). Rows are only ever added: a correction adds new rows marked বর্তমান and the earlier ones marked পুরনো (সংশোধিত) / ডুপ্লিকেট / বাদ (অ্যাডমিন সিদ্ধান্ত). Failed copies are retried every night.
- Every night (03:00 Dhaka) all survey tables are backed up as JSON to a private Vercel Blob store; the last 30 days are kept.

## Go-live checklist (developer)

- Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables:
  - Production and Preview: `FORM_GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID` (pre-admission form), `SURVEY_SHEET_ID`, `CRON_SECRET`, `STUDIO_AUTH_ENABLED=true`, `STUDIO_USERNAME`, `STUDIO_PASSWORD`.
  - Production: `DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` (from the Neon integration). Preview: the same two names pointing at the Neon `dev` branch.
  - Create a **private** Blob store (Storage → Blob, access: private), connect it with the prefix `SURVEY_BACKUP_BLOB` → `SURVEY_BACKUP_BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`. Without it the nightly job reports a failure.
  - Leave `SURVEY_SHEET_ID` empty in Preview if preview submissions should not reach the real sheet.
- Database migrations run on every Vercel build (`vercel-build` → `scripts/migrate-if-configured.mjs`, then `next build`). Without `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` the step is skipped with a warning so the public site still deploys; a failing migration stops the deploy. If the project has a custom Build Command, change it to `pnpm run vercel-build`.
- Studio: survey teachers, subjects and ERP section names are loaded (2026-10-05); fill in the eight missing Bengali teacher names. Import the real ERP list in production once (`/admin` → ERP ইমপোর্ট); the dry run on the 2026-10-05 export mapped all 148 students with no problems.
- Remove the local sample data from the dev branch when it is no longer needed: `pnpm survey:fixtures --remove`.

## Developer commands

- `pnpm test` (unit, offline) · `pnpm test:db` (Neon dev branch, cleans up after itself) · `pnpm test:e2e`
- `test:db`, `survey:fixtures` and the database e2e specs write data, so they refuse to run unless `.env.local` has `SURVEY_DEV_DB=1` — set it only while `DATABASE_URL` points at the dev branch (`vercel env pull` rewrites the file and removes it).
- `pnpm db:generate` / `pnpm db:migrate` (migrations in `drizzle/`)
- `pnpm survey:fixtures` loads sample rounds, students and submissions into the dev branch (open link printed); `--remove` deletes them.
- `pnpm exec tsx scripts/survey-seed.ts` creates missing Studio survey documents (areas, T1 template, classes with subjects) and fills empty subject lists / ERP section names on existing classes; `--teachers <ERP teacher export .xlsx>` also adds missing survey teachers (the list is read from the file, never committed: the repository is public); `--overwrite` replaces the seeded documents (only before any round opens).
