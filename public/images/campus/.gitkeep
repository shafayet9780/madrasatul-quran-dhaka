# Campus Images Directory

This directory contains campus facility images for the virtual tour.
In a real implementation, these would be high-quality photos of:

- prayer-hall.jpg - Beautiful prayer hall with Islamic architecture  
- library.jpg - Well-stocked library with reading areas
- science-lab.jpg - Modern science laboratory
- quran-room.jpg - Quran memorization room
- playground.jpg - Sports playground and facilities
- computer-lab.jpg - Computer laboratory with modern PCs
- admin-office.jpg - Administrative office building

For development, you can add placeholder images or use a service like Unsplash for sample images.
